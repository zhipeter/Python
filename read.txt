There are many differences between fast-paced lifestyle and slow-paced lifestyle. Most middle-aged and young people living a fast-paced lifestyle have high efficiency and want to finish everything immediately. But it¡¯s regretful for them to miss small and hidden beauties of life as they focus attention on their work. Slow-paced lifestyle means more inefficient than fast-paced lifestyle. Who prefer to spend time on relaxing and thinking are nearly elder people. However, some people think they are less of passion and what they do is a waste of time. Overall, it¡¯s not a good idea to let the two kinds of people work together.
